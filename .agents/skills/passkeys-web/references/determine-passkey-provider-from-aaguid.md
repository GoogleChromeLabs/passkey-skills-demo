# Determine the passkey provider from AAGUID

An AAGUID (Authenticator Attestation Globally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier that represents the model of the authenticator, not a specific instance. It is included in the authenticator data during passkey registration and can be used to determine which passkey provider (e.g. Google Password Manager, iCloud Keychain, 1Password) created a credential.

AAGUID should only be used to help users with passkey management. It can be modified unless cryptographically attested, which platform passkeys currently don't support.

## 1. AAGUID Registry

A community-maintained JSON mapping of AAGUIDs to provider names and icons is available at:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/passkeydeveloper/passkey-authenticator-aaguids/refs/heads/main/combined_aaguid.json
```

Each entry has the following schema:

```json
{
  "<aaguid-uuid>": {
    "name": "Provider Name",
    "icon_light": "data:image/png;base64,...",
    "icon_dark": "data:image/png;base64,..."
  }
}
```

## 2. Using AAGUID After Registration

After verifying a registration response, read the `aaguid` from the registration result and look it up against the registry to populate the credential's `name` and `providerIcon`:

```javascript
import aaguids from './aaguids.json' with { type: 'json' };

const { aaguid } = registrationInfo;
if (aaguid === '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') {
  // use the device name as the passkey provider based on
  // the information derived from ithe user agent string,
  // or just say "Unknown passkey provider"
} else {
  const provider = aaguids[aaguid];
  const credential = {
    // ...other fields
    aaguid,
    name: provider?.name || 'Unknown passkey provider',
    providerIcon: provider?.icon_light,
  };
}
```

## 3. Fallback if AAGUID is zeroed or not found

If the AAGUID is `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`, treat it as an unknown provider and fall back to a generic label. In such case, use the device name as the passkey provider based on the information derived from ithe user agent string, or just say "Unknown passkey provider".

## 4. Passkey Management UI

Use the AAGUID-derived name and icon when displaying registered passkeys so users can identify which provider holds each credential. Combine with the registration date and last-used date for additional context.
